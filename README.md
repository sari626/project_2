# 🐦 Bird Species Observation Analysis in Forest and Grassland Ecosystem

This project focuses on analyzing the distribution and diversity of bird species across two major ecosystems: **forests** and **grasslands**. It uses real-world observational data to derive ecological insights, support conservation efforts, and visualize patterns through interactive dashboards.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand how environmental factors influence bird populations.
- Identify habitat preferences, biodiversity hotspots, and seasonal activity.
- Support wildlife conservation, eco-tourism, and sustainable land use with actionable insights.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data Manipulation
- **SQL**: Data Storage & Queries
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: Data Visualization
- **Streamlit / Power BI**: Interactive Dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: Code Development

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset comprises multiple Excel sheets representing bird observations across various administrative units. It includes:

- Species details (Common & Scientific names)
- Habitat type (Forest / Grassland)
- Observation conditions (Temperature, Wind, Sky)
- Observer details, timing, and method
- Conservation status

Each sheet corresponds to a national park or protected area (e.g., ANTI, CHOH, GWMP).

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

### 1. Temporal Analysis
- Bird sightings by **year**, **season**, and **time of day**

### 2. Spatial Analysis
- Biodiversity by **location**, **plot**, and **habitat**

### 3. Species Behavior
- Frequency of **singing**, **flyovers**, **distance** from observer

### 4. Environmental Factors
- Effects of **temperature**, **humidity**, and **disturbance**

### 5. Conservation Insights
- Focus on **watchlist species** and **at-risk populations**
